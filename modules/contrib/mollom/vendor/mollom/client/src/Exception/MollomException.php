/**
 * A catchable Mollom exception.
 *
 * The Mollom class internally uses exceptions to handle HTTP request errors
 * within the Mollom::handleRequest() method. All exceptions thrown in the
 * Mollom class and derived classes should be instances of the MollomException
 * class if they pertain to errors that can be catched/handled within the class.
 * Other errors should not use the MollomException class and handled
 * differently.
 *
 * No MollomException is supposed to pile up as a user-facing fatal error. All
 * functions that invoke Mollom::handleRequest() have to catch Mollom
 * exceptions.
 *
 * @see Mollom::query()
 * @see Mollom::handleRequest()
 *
 * @param $message
 *   The Exception message to throw.
 * @param $code
 *   The Exception code.
 * @param $previous
 *   (optional) The previous Exception, if any.
 * @param $instance
 *   The Mollom class instance the Exception is thrown in.
 * @param $arguments
 *   (optional) A associative array containing information about a performed
 *   HTTP request that failed:
 *   - request: (string) The HTTP method and URI of the performed request; e.g.,
 *     "GET http://server.mollom.com/v1/foo/bar". In case of GET requests, do
 *     not add query parameters to the URI; pass them in 'data' instead.
 *   - data: (array) An associative array containing HTTP GET/POST/PUT request
 *     query parameters that were sent to the server.
 *   - response: (mixed) The server response, either as string, or the already
 *     parsed response; i.e., an array.
